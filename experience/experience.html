                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I was lucky enough to begin my journey with Decentology in September of 2020, and I have
                    been working here ever since. I am currently serving as the lead Cadence developer,
                    which is the smart contract language for the <a href="https://www.onflow.org/" target="_blank"
                        style="color: lightgreen;">Flow blockchain</a>.
                </p>
                <img src="../gifs/motogpignition.png" />
                <p>Up to this point, my achievements have included designing, architecting, and implementing
                    the smart contracts, transactions, and scripts for <a href="https://motogp-ignition.com/"
                        target="_blank" style="color: rgb(231, 37, 111)">MotoGP
                        Ignition</a>
                    to handle the minting, trading, and buying/selling of hundreds of thousands of packs on the Flow
                    blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, my primary focus has been architecting and implementing multiple modules for <a
                        href="https://dappstarter.decentology.com/" target="_blank">DappStarter</a>, our main product.
                    DappStarter is
                    designed to help
                    developers
                    quickly kick off their dApp development by providing them
                    with out-of-the-box code. The developer can select any blockchain and pre-existing module and they
                    will have a fully working full stack application in minutes. For example, a developer might want to
                    quickly
                    set up a full stack application that has to do with Voting on the blockchain. They can select
                    their desired blockchain along with the Voting module and have a completely ready-to-go app with
                    server
                    side
                    tests and a UI harness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment I am mostly handling anything
                    related to development on the Flow blockchain. The wonderful thing about a smaller team, though, is
                    that I am
                    also a part of developing on Ethereum, product development, product strategy, and many things in the
                    business environment,
                    so I have gotten to learn so so much!! I am very grateful.
