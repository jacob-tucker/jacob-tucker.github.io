      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>I built a social media network that allows users to add songs to their library and a database, create
        playlists, and join
        communities based on their love for music where they can communicate and connect with others of similar
        musical interests.</p>

    <div class="highlights">
      <h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
      <p>•Firebase authentication allows users to login/signup and logout whenever they want, and prevents outside
        interference with the database.</p>
      <p>•Users can add songs to the general database, add songs to their personal library, and create playlists, which
        are all
        stored in each user's account in the Firestore database.</p>
      <p>•Users can create communities, join communities, contribute songs to communities, and have continuous
        conversations
        in the communtiies they join, which is all stored in the Firestore so conversations can be picked up whenever,
        and song
        lists can be continuously contributed to.</p>
      <p>•React-Redux handels client-database communications and handeles the overall state of the application.</p>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>Similarly to EasyTalk, I knew I wanted to further test my ability to create an actual product. As a side note,
        my dad and I absolutely love music, especially music from the 70s and 80s. We listen to it together all the
        time,
        and it made me think about ways he could interact with others around the world who share his love for music. I
        could
        not think of an application that is specifically talered towards users communicating about their love for
        musical
        history, the change of music over time, and their own experiences with it. The result was trying to create an
        app that attempted to solve this.</p>

      <p>Once a user signs in or signs up through firebase authentication, they have access to the an entire musical
        database that was created by users themselves. The idea is that users can add songs to the database to better
        the
        overall MusicLife community, or add songs specifically to individual communities that are run by users. Every
        user can
        then browse through all the songs that everyone who has signed up for the app has added and add those songs to a
        personalized library. The main Browse page also has the ability to display popular songs at the moment,
        latest tracks added, and popular communities.</p>

      <p>The social network part of the app comes into play with communities, which are ways for users to interact with
        each other. On the main Browse page with all the songs, there are also recommended communities to join, and
        communities that are popular at the moment. This will help a new user interact with communities they may not
        have
        known existed, help them spread their influence to communities they love, and get started on the app with new
        friends.</p>

      <p>Once a user has joined a community, they can discuss with others in that community about the songs they love,
        the history of the music of interest, or anything else. They can add songs from their own library or from the
        main
        Browse page to a list of songs specific to that community. One example of this would be an 80s community who
        loves
        80s music. They can discuss it, add songs to their community, and help their community thrive and potentially
        reach
        the top of the communities chart to help spread their influence.</p>
