            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I built a chat application that allows users to send messages simultaneously and pick up conversations
            from where they left off at any time, along with the ability to personally customize the design.</p>

          <div class="highlights">
            <h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
            <p>•Messages sent back and forth instantaneously through WebSockets (using Socket.io library), via a Node.js server using the Express library, hosted on Heroku.</p>
            <p>•Users can continue conversations at any time, enabled by retrieving user profiles and chat conversations stored on a NoSQL MongoDB Atlas cluster, using AWS as the cloud provider.</p>
            <p>•Enabled user personalization by giving users the ability to change the styling of their chat, which is kept using React hooks.</p>
            <p>•Axios library used to make simple GET/POST requests from React front end to Node.js server.
            <p>•Implemented JSON authentication tokens stored through browser cookies that prevent 3rd party data interference, using a built Restful API.</p>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>Knowing I had very little experience building actual products with my Computer Science knowledge, I really wanted
            to try and make a legitimate project to prove to myself I could create something. I've always been very inspired
            by people who can actually create web applications and make them look so good, even if they're very simple. I knew
            I wanted to go into something web related, and so I looked up how to start coding in React and how to create
            styling with CSS, and just went from there.</p>
            <p>After learning how React worked, I began building my server using Node.js. While trying to learn how to connect
            the two, I began searching for an idea of what to actually do with them. The result was EasyTalk, which in its beginning
            stages was very sloppy and didn't look too great. There was a lot of backend lag with messages and I couldn't
            get the JSON Web Tokens to work either. However, after another month of revamping the site, EasyTalkv2 arrived.</p>
            <p>EasyTalkv2 allows users to send messages back and forth and stores all the messages and user login information
            in a MongoDB Atlas Cluster, which means they can always go back through old messages and continue conversations. There is
            an "All Chat" option which allows all users to type to each other. Users can also click the audio button to play
            their message aloud before they send it.</p>
            <p>One of the features I knew I really wanted was a way to personalize the application for each user. Allowing users to
            changethe color scheme of EasyTalkv2 seemed to me as a great way to allow users to not only connect with their friends, family, and others
            by messaging, but also with the app itself, hopefully creating more interaction with the app. </p>
            <p>As a slight bonus, my dad now knows the link to EasyTalkv2 and cannot stop messaging me on it because he can't
            believe I made a website. So, if you see "Jacob's Dad" in All Chat, you know who it is!</p>
