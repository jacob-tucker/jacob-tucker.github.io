            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>A complete design overhaul of MusicLife, a social media platform for people who love music, with added
                functional components as well.

            <h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
            <p>•Completely redesigned MusicLife to make the platform much more clean and visibile to its users.</p>
            <p>•Added a feature where users can supply a link to the songs they add, so other users
                can easily view the songs they love without having to find them.
            </p>
            <p>•Users can now add songs to communities directly from the browse tab, without having to
                re-contribute the song.

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>I created MusicLife very early on in my front-end development career. At
                the time I was very focused on working with databases, storing data in them, and being
                able to retreive information. Thus, my focus was more on the Firebase aspects
                of the project rather than on the design.
            </p>
            <p>I ended up finishing the MusicLife project in July of 2020 (or so I thought),
                and recently decided to pick it back up again. I really wanted to prove my design skills,
                especially if I'm looking to go into front-end development. So, I decided there was no better
                way to do it then to do a design overhaul of my old project.
            </p>
            <p>The result was MusicLifev2, and I'm very proud of it. I added some new functional
                features along the way to aid in the design and the overall experience for the user.
                One added feature was the ability to attach a link to a song when it's contributed, so
                users who may not be as technologically advanced wouldn't have to search for the song.
                It would be right in front of them.
